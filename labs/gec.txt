It 's difficult to answer the question " what are you going to do in the future ? " if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher . I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology , because one day I would like to open my own psychology clinic and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it more easily .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that public transport will always exist in the future .
Rich people will buy a car , but poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider it more convenient to drive a car , because you carry more things in your own car than when travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask you to be friends and exchange telephone numbers .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car I used to use the bus to go to school and go back to my house .
