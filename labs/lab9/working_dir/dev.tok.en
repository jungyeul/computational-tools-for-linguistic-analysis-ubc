Food : Where European inflation slipped up
The skyward zoom in food prices is the dominant force behind the speed up in eurozone inflation .
November price hikes were higher than expected in the 13 eurozone countries , with October &apos;s 2.6 percent yr / yr inflation rate followed by 3.1 percent in November , the EU &apos;s Luxembourg-based statistical office reported .
Official forecasts predicted just 3 percent , Bloomberg said .
As opposed to the US , UK , and Canadian central banks , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) did not cut interest rates , arguing that a rate drop combined with rising raw material prices and declining unemployment would trigger an inflationary spiral .
The ECB wants to hold inflation to under two percent , or somewhere in that vicinity .
According to one analyst , ECB has been caught in a Catch-22 : It needs to &quot; talk down &quot; inflation , to keep from having to take action to push it down later in the game .
Germany &apos;s November inflation rate of 3.3 percent counts as a record ; in Spain the rate shot up to 4.1 percent from an earlier 3.6 .
Soaring food and energy prices sent eurozone inflation into the stratosphere .
Wheat futures were up by 88 percent and soybean prices were at their highest since 1973 .
